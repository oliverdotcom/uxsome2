what to do:

   1. Name your classes/id using a letter from your name:
      
      B = Bilyana
      M = Marko
      U = Mihaela
      O = Oliver

      example: <div class="bcontainer">lorem ipsum</div>


   
   2. Remember to pull whenever you start coding again, so you get everyones changes.
      Also, if you are having problems with pushing your changes, try pulling first.
